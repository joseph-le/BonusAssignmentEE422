I don't have a partner, but I'm making this Git Repo to satisfy some stuff.

This project contains 5 java files which lie in the bonus package...

Code.java - Mastermind code data structure
CodeValidator.java - Validates if a string is a valid code
Driver.java - The main program that runs the Mastermind game. Creates a game object and handles basic input
Game.java - The actual game object
History.java - Game's history data structure. Displays request and response data.
